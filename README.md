These papers collectively suggest that quantum computing has the potential to revolutionize financial modeling. 
They highlight various financial applications where quantum computing can provide computational advantages over classical computers. 
The papers discuss areas such as derivative pricing, risk analysis, portfolio optimization, natural language processing, fraud detection, and credit scoring. 
The algorithms and methodologies adapted for quantum computers include Monte Carlo integration, optimization, and machine learning. 
The feasibility of these algorithms on near-term quantum computers with different hardware implementations is also explored. 
The papers emphasize that finance is expected to be one of the first industry sectors to benefit from quantum computing, both in the short and long term
